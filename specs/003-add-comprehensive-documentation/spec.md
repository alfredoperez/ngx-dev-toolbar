# Feature Specification: Comprehensive Documentation Website

**Feature Branch**: `003-add-comprehensive-documentation`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add comprehensive documentation to docs website with landing page and detailed tool guides with examples"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Developer Learns About Specific Tools (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to understand how to use specific tools (Feature Flags, Language Switcher, Permissions, App Features, Presets) in their application. They need clear explanations, API references, and working code examples.

**Why this priority**: Detailed tool documentation is essential for successful implementation. Without clear guides and examples, developers cannot effectively use the library.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by navigating to any tool's documentation page and verifying it contains a complete explanation, API reference, usage examples, and integration instructions. Delivers value by enabling developers to successfully implement any single tool.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer navigates to a tool's documentation page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see a comprehensive guide including: purpose, use cases, API reference, and code examples
2. **Given** a developer is reading tool documentation, **When** they view code examples, **Then** they see syntax-highlighted, copy-able code snippets with explanations
3. **Given** a developer needs API details, **When** they scroll to the API section, **Then** they see method signatures, parameter descriptions, return types, and usage notes
4. **Given** a developer wants to see the tool in action, **When** they view examples, **Then** they see both basic and advanced implementation patterns
5. **Given** a developer finishes reading about one tool, **When** they look for navigation, **Then** they see links to other tool documentation and can easily switch between tools

---

### User Story 2 - Developer Navigates Documentation (Priority: P2)

A developer using the documentation needs to easily find specific information, navigate between different sections, and understand the overall structure of the library's capabilities.

**Why this priority**: Good navigation improves user experience and reduces time-to-value. However, it's secondary to having the actual content available.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying the navigation menu works correctly, displays all sections, highlights the current page, and allows quick jumping between documentation sections. Delivers value by making the existing documentation more accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer is on any documentation page, **When** they view the page, **Then** they see a persistent navigation menu showing all documentation sections
2. **Given** a developer is on a specific tool's page, **When** they look at the navigation, **Then** the current page is highlighted/indicated
3. **Given** a developer clicks a navigation link, **When** the new page loads, **Then** the navigation persists and updates to show the new current page
4. **Given** a developer is on mobile, **When** they access the documentation, **Then** they see a responsive menu that adapts to smaller screens

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a developer accesses documentation for a tool that doesn't exist (404 page)?
- How does the site handle very long code examples that might break layout?
- What happens when JavaScript is disabled (progressive enhancement)?
- How does the documentation handle different screen sizes and devices?
- What happens when a developer tries to copy code examples with special characters?

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Documentation Page**: Represents a single documentation page with title, content, route path, and navigation metadata
- **Tool Documentation**: Represents complete documentation for a specific tool including API reference, examples, use cases
- **Code Example**: Represents a code snippet with syntax highlighting metadata, language, and copyable content

- SEO optimization (meta tags, structured data) for documentation pages
- Routing for deep-linking to specific tool documentation

### Out of Scope

- Landing page modifications (already complete and satisfactory)
- Documentation search functionality
- Interactive playground/sandbox for trying tools
- User authentication or personalized documentation

- Documentation will be maintained in the same repository as the library code
- Documentation is targeting Angular developers familiar with TypeScript and RxJS
- All tools are stable and their APIs will not change during documentation creation
- Code examples will use Angular 19+ syntax (standalone components, signals)
- Developers have basic understanding of Angular concepts (components, services, dependency injection)
- Documentation site is static-generated for performance and hosting simplicity
- Tool icons and visual assets are already available in the project

## Non-Functional Requirements *(optional - only if relevant)*
