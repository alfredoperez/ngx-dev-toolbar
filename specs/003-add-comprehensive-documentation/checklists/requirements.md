# Specification Quality Checklist: Comprehensive Documentation Website

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Content Quality - PASSED

- Specification focuses on what developers need (documentation, examples, navigation) without specifying implementation technologies
- Written in clear language accessible to product owners and stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Scope) are complete

### ✅ Requirement Completeness - PASSED

- All 29 functional requirements are specific and testable (e.g., "Each tool page MUST display syntax-highlighted code examples")
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (e.g., "within 30 seconds", "2 clicks", "under 2 seconds", "90% task completion rate")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details - focused on user outcomes
- All user stories have clear acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format
- Edge cases identified (404 handling, layout with long code, mobile responsiveness, etc.)
- Clear scope boundaries defined (in-scope: 5 tool docs, out-of-scope: version switching, multi-language, interactive playground)
- Dependencies listed (existing docs app, SEO service, routing) and assumptions documented (Angular 19+ syntax, developer audience)

### ✅ Feature Readiness - PASSED

- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios prioritized (P1: Landing + Tool Docs, P2: Navigation, P3: Search) and independently testable
- Success criteria provide clear measurable outcomes (time, clicks, completion rates)
- No framework-specific or implementation details present in requirements or success criteria

## Notes

**Status**: ✅ Specification is complete and ready for planning phase

All checklist items pass validation. The specification:
- Clearly defines what needs to be built (5 tool documentation pages, navigation, code examples)
- Provides measurable success criteria focused on user outcomes
- Maintains technology-agnostic language throughout
- Includes 24 comprehensive functional requirements covering all aspects (content, navigation, examples, responsiveness)
- Properly scopes the feature with clear boundaries (landing page and search explicitly out of scope)
- Has no ambiguous or unclear requirements requiring clarification

**Updates**:
- Removed landing page work (user confirmed existing landing page is satisfactory)
- Removed search functionality (out of scope for now)
- Reduced from 4 user stories to 2 focused user stories (P1: Tool Documentation, P2: Navigation)
- Requirements renumbered from FR-001 to FR-024 for clarity

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` phase to create implementation planning document.
