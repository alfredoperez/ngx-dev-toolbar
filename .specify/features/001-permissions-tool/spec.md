# Feature Specification: Permissions Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-permissions-tool`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Permissions tool with demo integration and documentation"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Developer Forces Permission Override (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to test UI behavior when a user has specific permissions without backend changes or user account switching. They need to override permission states at runtime to verify permission-based UI rendering and access control.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that delivers immediate value. Enables developers to test permission-dependent features in isolation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by setting available permissions via service API, forcing a permission to granted/denied via UI, and verifying the forced value is received by the consuming application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the developer has configured available permissions via `setAvailableOptions()`, **When** they open the permissions tool and select "Granted" for "can-edit-posts", **Then** the forced permission is persisted to localStorage and emitted via `getForcedValues()`
2. **Given** a permission is forced to "Denied", **When** the developer selects "Not Forced", **Then** the permission returns to its original app-provided state
3. **Given** multiple permissions are available, **When** the developer forces some to granted and others to denied, **Then** only the forced permissions are emitted via `getForcedValues()`

---

### User Story 2 - Search and Filter Permissions (Priority: P2)

As the application grows, developers need to quickly find specific permissions among many. They want to search by name and filter by permission state (forced, granted, denied).

**Why this priority**: Enhances usability for apps with many permissions. Not critical for MVP but significantly improves developer experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring 20+ permissions, searching by text, and verifying filtered results. Filter dropdown functionality can be verified independently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 20 permissions are available, **When** the developer types "edit" in the search box, **Then** only permissions with "edit" in name or description are displayed
2. **Given** permissions are in various states, **When** the developer selects "Forced" filter, **Then** only permissions with forced overrides are shown
3. **Given** a search query and filter are active, **When** the developer clears the search, **Then** the filter remains active

---

### User Story 3 - Persist Permission Overrides (Priority: P1)

Permission overrides must persist across page refreshes so developers don't lose their testing configuration. The toolbar should automatically restore forced permissions from localStorage on page load.

**Why this priority**: Critical for developer workflow. Without persistence, every page refresh requires reconfiguration.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by forcing permissions, refreshing the page, and verifying the forced state is restored from localStorage.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the developer has forced "can-delete-users" to granted, **When** they refresh the page, **Then** the permission remains forced to granted
2. **Given** multiple permissions are forced, **When** the application restarts, **Then** all forced permissions are restored
3. **Given** a forced permission's ID no longer exists in available options, **When** the toolbar loads, **Then** the invalid override is ignored gracefully

---

### User Story 4 - Demo App Integration (Priority: P1)

Developers evaluating the library need a working example in the demo app showing how to integrate the permissions tool. The demo should show realistic permissions and react to forced values.

**Why this priority**: Critical for adoption. Developers learn by example. Without a working demo, integration is unclear.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the demo app, forcing permissions, and verifying the demo UI responds to changes (e.g., buttons appear/disappear based on permissions).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the demo app is running, **When** the developer opens the permissions tool, **Then** realistic sample permissions (can-edit-posts, can-delete-users, etc.) are displayed
2. **Given** a permission is forced to granted, **When** the demo UI renders, **Then** permission-dependent UI elements appear
3. **Given** a permission is forced to denied, **When** the demo UI renders, **Then** permission-dependent UI elements are hidden
4. **Given** the developer views the demo app code, **When** they examine the integration, **Then** clear examples of `setAvailableOptions()` and `getForcedValues()` are visible

---

### User Story 5 - Documentation and Usage Guidance (Priority: P1)

Developers need clear documentation to understand how to integrate and use the permissions tool. Documentation should cover API, usage examples, and best practices.

**Why this priority**: Critical for adoption and proper usage. Without docs, developers struggle with integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by following the documentation to integrate the tool in a fresh project.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer reads the root README.md, **When** they look for available tools, **Then** the permissions tool is listed with a brief description
2. **Given** a developer reads `libs/ngx-dev-toolbar/src/tools/README.md`, **When** they want to understand the permissions tool, **Then** complete API documentation, usage examples, and data models are provided
3. **Given** a developer reads the tool README, **When** they want to see integration code, **Then** TypeScript examples for both simple and advanced use cases are provided
4. **Given** a developer reads the documentation, **When** they want to understand preset integration, **Then** information about `applyPresetPermissions()` and `getCurrentForcedState()` is included

---

### User Story 6 - Empty States and Loading (Priority: P3)

Developers need clear feedback when no permissions are configured or when filters produce no results. Empty states guide developers on next steps.

**Why this priority**: Improves UX but not critical for core functionality. Can be added after core features work.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting with no permissions configured, then adding permissions and applying filters that produce no results.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no permissions have been set via `setAvailableOptions()`, **When** the developer opens the permissions tool, **Then** a message "No permissions found" is displayed
2. **Given** permissions exist but search produces no results, **When** the developer searches for "xyz", **Then** "No permissions match your filter" is displayed
3. **Given** an empty state is shown, **When** the developer clears the search/filter, **Then** all permissions reappear

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a permission is forced but then removed from available options? (Answer: Gracefully ignored, logged as warning)
- How does the system handle permissions with duplicate IDs? (Answer: Last one wins, log warning)
- What if `setAvailableOptions()` is called multiple times? (Answer: Replaces previous options, preserves forced state for matching IDs)
- How are permissions with missing names handled? (Answer: Use ID as fallback display name)
- What happens when localStorage quota is exceeded? (Answer: Catch error, warn user, continue with in-memory state)

### Key Entities

- **DevToolbarPermission**: Represents a single permission with `id` (unique identifier), `name` (display name), `description` (optional explanation), `isGranted` (current state from app or forced), and `isForced` (whether overridden by toolbar)
- **ForcedPermissionsState**: Internal state structure storing `granted: string[]` (IDs of permissions forced to granted) and `denied: string[]` (IDs of permissions forced to denied)
