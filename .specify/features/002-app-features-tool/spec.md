# Feature Specification: App Features Tool

**Feature Branch**: `002-app-features-tool`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "App Features Tool - Test product-level feature availability like license tiers, deployment configurations, and environment flags without backend changes"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Developer Forces Product Feature Override (Priority: P1)

A developer needs to test how the application behaves with different product configurations (e.g., Enterprise vs Free tier features) without changing backend configuration or deployment environment.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that enables the primary use case - testing product features without backend changes. This is the MVP that delivers immediate value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring available features via API, forcing a feature to enabled/disabled via UI, and verifying the application receives the forced value. Delivers standalone value for testing product configurations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer has configured available app features via setAvailableOptions(), **When** developer forces a feature to "enabled" via UI dropdown, **Then** application receives the feature with isEnabled=true and isForced=true via getForcedValues()
2. **Given** a feature is forced to enabled, **When** developer changes it to "disabled" via UI, **Then** application receives the feature with isEnabled=false and isForced=true
3. **Given** a feature is forced to any state, **When** developer selects "Not Forced", **Then** feature returns to original state and application no longer receives it in getForcedValues()

### User Story 2 - Search and Filter App Features (Priority: P2)

A developer working with a large application with many product features needs to quickly find specific features to test without scrolling through long lists.

**Why this priority**: Productivity enhancement for applications with many features (10+). Important for UX but not blocking core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by configuring 15+ features, using search to filter by name/description, and using dropdown to filter by state (all/forced/enabled/disabled). Delivers value independent of forcing functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 15 app features are configured, **When** developer types "analytics" in search, **Then** only features with "analytics" in name or description are displayed
2. **Given** multiple features are displayed, **When** developer selects "Forced" filter, **Then** only features with forced overrides are shown
3. **Given** search query "multi" and filter "Enabled" are active, **When** features are rendered, **Then** only enabled features matching "multi" are displayed (combined filters)

---

### User Story 3 - Persist Feature Overrides Across Sessions (Priority: P1)

A developer testing a specific product configuration needs their feature overrides to persist across page refreshes and browser sessions to avoid reconfiguring repeatedly.

**Why this priority**: Critical for developer experience - prevents frustration and saves time. Part of core MVP functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by forcing features, refreshing page, and verifying forced state persists. Delivers standalone value for maintaining test configurations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer has forced 3 features to enabled, **When** page is refreshed, **Then** all 3 forced features retain their forced state
2. **Given** forced features exist in localStorage, **When** application loads, **Then** forced features are automatically applied and emitted via getForcedValues()
3. **Given** a forced feature ID no longer exists in configured options, **When** application loads, **Then** invalid feature is removed from localStorage with warning logged to console

---

### User Story 4 - Preset Integration for Automated Testing (Priority: P2)

A QA engineer or developer needs to programmatically apply feature configurations from presets for automated E2E testing scenarios without manual UI interaction.

**Why this priority**: Enables advanced testing workflows and preset tool integration. Valuable but not required for basic MVP.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by calling applyPresetFeatures() method with predefined state and verifying all features update correctly. Works independently of UI.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** presets tool has a saved configuration, **When** presets service calls applyPresetFeatures() with feature state, **Then** all specified features are forced to their preset values and persist to localStorage
2. **Given** current feature configuration exists, **When** developer calls getCurrentForcedState(), **Then** method returns current forced state as { enabled: string[], disabled: string[] }

---

### User Story 5 - Empty States and User Guidance (Priority: P3)

A developer using the tool for the first time or with no features configured needs clear guidance on what to do next.

**Why this priority**: Improves first-time user experience but not blocking. Developers can figure it out from documentation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by rendering tool with no configured features, then with configured features but no search results. UI displays appropriate messages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** no app features are configured, **When** tool is opened, **Then** empty state message "No app features found" with hint "Call setAvailableOptions() to configure features" is displayed
2. **Given** features are configured but search/filter returns no results, **When** UI renders, **Then** "No features match your filter" message is displayed
3. **Given** features match current search/filter, **When** UI renders, **Then** features list is displayed with search and filter controls

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a forced feature ID is removed from available options on subsequent page load?
- How does system handle duplicate feature IDs provided to setAvailableOptions()?
- What if setAvailableOptions() is called multiple times with different feature lists?
- How to handle features with missing names or descriptions?
- What if localStorage quota is exceeded when persisting forced features?
- How does filtering behave when search query is empty vs when it has no matches?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a public service implementing DevToolsService<DevToolbarAppFeature> interface
- **FR-002**: Developers MUST be able to configure available app features via setAvailableOptions(features: DevToolbarAppFeature[])
- **FR-003**: Developers MUST be able to force app features to enabled/disabled state via UI dropdown (Not Forced / Enabled / Disabled)
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist forced app feature state to localStorage with key 'AngularDevTools.app-features'
- **FR-005**: System MUST load forced app feature state from localStorage on initialization
- **FR-006**: System MUST emit forced app features via getForcedValues() Observable when state changes
- **FR-007**: System MUST support search functionality filtering features by name and description (case-insensitive)
- **FR-008**: System MUST support filter dropdown with options: All / Forced / Enabled / Disabled
- **FR-009**: System MUST display empty state message when no features are configured
- **FR-010**: System MUST display "no results" message when search/filter produces no matches
- **FR-011**: System MUST follow existing dev toolbar architecture patterns (dual-service, signals, OnPush)
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide preset integration methods: applyPresetFeatures() and getCurrentForcedState()
- **FR-013**: System MUST integrate seamlessly with demo app showing real-time feature-based UI updates
- **FR-014**: System MUST render features in scrollable list when more than viewport height
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate and clean forced feature IDs on page load (remove invalid IDs)
- **FR-016**: System MUST log warnings when forced features reference non-existent feature IDs

### Key Entities

- **DevToolbarAppFeature**: Represents a product-level application feature with id, name, description (optional), isEnabled (current state), and isForced (whether overridden by toolbar)
- **ForcedAppFeaturesState**: Stores forced feature overrides with enabled array (feature IDs forced to enabled) and disabled array (feature IDs forced to disabled)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can configure and force app features in under 30 seconds
- **SC-002**: Forced feature overrides persist across page refreshes with 100% reliability
- **SC-003**: Search returns results in under 100ms for feature lists up to 100 items
- **SC-004**: Demo app UI updates within 100ms of feature override change
- **SC-005**: Unit test coverage exceeds 80% for all services and components
- **SC-006**: Zero console errors or warnings during normal operation
- **SC-007**: Demo app demonstrates at least 3 real-world product feature scenarios (e.g., basic tier, professional tier, enterprise tier)
- **SC-008**: Tool integrates with presets system without requiring preset tool changes

## Assumptions *(include when making informed guesses)*

1. **Feature Storage Format**: Forced features will be stored as `{ enabled: string[], disabled: string[] }` matching the pattern used by feature flags and permissions tools
2. **Service Architecture**: Will follow dual-service pattern (internal service for state, public service for API) consistent with existing tools
3. **Icon**: Will use 'puzzle' icon to represent product features/capabilities
4. **Filter Behavior**: "Enabled" filter shows features where isEnabled=true, "Disabled" shows isEnabled=false, regardless of forced state
5. **localStorage Validation**: Invalid feature IDs will be removed from localStorage silently with console warning, not throwing errors
6. **Performance Target**: Search/filter operations will use the same optimized computed signal pattern as permissions tool

## Dependencies

- **Existing Tools**: Requires feature flags tool and permissions tool patterns as reference implementation
- **Presets Tool**: Must expose preset integration methods for future presets tool integration
- **Demo App**: Requires demo app updates to showcase product feature scenarios
- **Design System**: Uses existing ndt-input, ndt-select, ndt-toolbar-tool components

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT included in this feature:

- Backend API integration for fetching product features
- Feature dependency management (e.g., "if feature X is enabled, feature Y must also be enabled")
- Feature grouping or categorization UI
- Bulk operations (enable all, disable all)
- Export/import individual feature configurations (handled by presets tool)
- Cloud sync or team sharing of feature configurations
- Feature usage analytics or tracking
- Multi-environment feature management
