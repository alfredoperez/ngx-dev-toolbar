</div>

## Built-in Tools

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Feature Flags" icon="setting">
    Toggle features on or off in real-time without backend changes. Test different user experiences and validate A/B scenarios during development.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Permissions" icon="approve-check-circle">
    Test role-based access control by forcing permissions on or off. Verify authorization logic without switching user accounts.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Presets" icon="star">
    Save complete toolbar configurations as presets. Switch between QA, demo, and debug setups with one click.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Tools" icon="puzzle">
    Build your own tools using the toolbar's extensible architecture. See the [custom tool guide](/ngx-dev-toolbar/guides/custom-tool/).
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Key Features

- **Zero Production Impact** — toolbar code is tree-shaken out of production builds
- **Secure Implementation** — only loads in development mode via `isDevMode()`
- **Persistent Settings** — all overrides are saved to localStorage across sessions
- **Hidden by Default** — toggle visibility with `Ctrl+Shift+D`
- **Custom Tools Support** — extend the toolbar with your own tools
